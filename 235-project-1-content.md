# Proposal Page
## High Concept
The classic 3x3 strategy game, times 3!

## Platform
Desktop Only.

## Esthetics
Graphics: Simple, sleek. 
Basic sounds for placing markers.

##Gameplay
The two player game will run just as a normal game of tic tac toe. On their turn, players will be able to look with multiple camera angles at the board, looking at one board at a time, or viewing all three on a skewed angle. The game will be controlled with mouse and keyboard. Mouse will operate placing the markers, while the keyboard will manage angles.
The game will be fairly obvious to play. For the tutorial happy, the first game will say 'get 3 in a row!' As for the depth of the game, going off the provided definition of depth, (the number of emergent experientially different possibilities (or meaningful choices) that come out of one ruleset.) the exact depth of the game is 1.0888869e+28, or 27 factorial.

##Screenshots
